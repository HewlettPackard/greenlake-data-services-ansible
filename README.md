###  HPE Greenlake Data Services Configuration

#### Using a JSON Configuration File

To use the HPE Greenlake Data Services collection, you can store the configuration in a JSON file.
Here's an example:

```json
{
  "host": "<host>",
  "client_id": "<client_id>",
  "client_secret": "<client_secret>"
}
```

Once you have defined the config variables, you can run the roles.

#### Parameters in roles

The another way is to pass the credentials through explicit specification on the task.

This option allows the parameters `host`, `client_id`, `client_secret` to be passed directly inside your task.

```yaml
- name: Create GreenLake DSCC Host
  greenlake_host:
    host: <host>
    client_id: <client_id>
    client_secret: <client_secret>
    state: present
    data:
      initiator_ids:
        - "f582f56aa7b24964aca9b08496d7e378"
      name: "hostAnsibleTest"
      operating_system: "Ubuntu"
      user_created: True
- debug: var=hosts
```
